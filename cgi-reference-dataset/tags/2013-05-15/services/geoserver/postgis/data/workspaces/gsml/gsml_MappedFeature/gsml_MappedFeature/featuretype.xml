    <abstract>A MappedFeature is part of a geological interpretation. 
        It provides a link between a notional feature (description package) and one spatial representation of it, or part of it. (Exposures, Surface Traces and Intercepts, etc)
        * the specific bounded occurrence, such as an outcrop or map polygon
        * the Mapped Feature carries a geometry or shape
        - the association with a Geologic Feature (legend item) provides specification of all the other descriptors
        - the association with a Sampling Feature provides the context and dimensionality         
        A Mapped Feature is always associated with some sampling feature - e.g. a mapping surface, a section, a Borehole (see BoreHolesAndObservation) etc.  As noted on the diagram, if the associated sampling feature is a Borehole, then the shape associated with the MappedFeature will usually be either a point or an interval. This reconciles the 2-D ("map", section) and 1-D (borehole, traverse) viewpoints in a common abstraction.</abstract>
