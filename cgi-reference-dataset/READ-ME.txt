ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
This product is derived from data compiled by the Earth Resources Development Division, Department of Primary Industries, Victoria, Australia (http://www.dpi.vic.gov.au/earth-resources). It has been adapted for the purposes of this reference dataset and it should not be considered a scientific or geological dataset. While it is intended to be geologically plausible, it may be augmented with content created for illustrative purposes alone. It should therefore not be used for any geological purpose and responsibility is taken for inappropriate use of these data.

ABOUT

NOTES
1. All development is undertaken in the trunk folder.
2. Stable releases will be created as snapshots in the tags directory. Eg:
