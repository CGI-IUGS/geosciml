Did not model Geologic Time since it has been done by Simon already
Did not model "collection".  RDF already has classes for this (bag, list, etc..)
Borehole on hold
Analysis is O&M heavy - need a good O&M encoding (or SOSA ?)

Properties.
For now, all properties that refers to "vocabularies" are just routed to "owl:Thing" instead of SKOS.  To be discussed
linked to "skos:Concept" implies that all vocabularies are references to resources that are "rdf:type skos:Concept" - maybe 
this is the intent ?
