The <font color=\"#4f81bd\">fabricType</font> describes a pattern, defined by one or more <font color=\"#4f81bd\">CompoundMaterial</font> constituents, that is present throughout a rock body when considered at some scale. It is defined based on the average configuration of many constituents. Penetrative fabric denotes that these constituents are distributed throughout the rock volume at the scale of observation, and are repeated at distances that are small relative to the scale of the whole, such that they can be considered to pervade the whole uniformly.",
