	"description":"The <font color=\"#4f81bd\">MaterialRelation</font> class describes the relationships between constituent parts in an <font color=\"#4f81bd\">EarthMaterial</font> (e.g. A mineral overgrowth on a phenocryst within a granite).  \u000d\u000aExample:  Consider an overgrowth of albite on plagioclase in a granite. The Source would originate with the albite constituentPart description.  In this case, the Target would point to the plagioclase <font color=\"#4f81bd\">constituentPart</font> description and the relationship attribute would be 'overgrowth' and the <font color=\"#4f81bd\">sourceRole</font> is 'overgrows'.  Other appropriate role attributes might include: crosscuts, replaces, etc. for crosscutting and replacement relationships.  Inverse relationships must be explicitly recorded.",
