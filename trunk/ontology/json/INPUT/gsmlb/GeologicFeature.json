	"description":"The abstract <font color=\"#4f81bd\">GeologicFeature</font> class represents a conceptual feature that is hypothesized to exist coherently in the world. It corresponds with a \"legend item\" from a traditional geologic map and its instance acts as the \"description package\".  The description package is classified according to its intended purpose as a <i>typicalNorm</i>, <i>definingNorm or instance</i>.  <font color=\"#4f81bd\">GeologicFeature</font> can be used outside the context of a map (it can lack a <font color=\"#4f81bd\">MappedFeature</font>), for example when describing typical norms (describing expected property from a feature) or defining norms (describing properties required from a feature to be classifying in a group, such as given geologic unit).  A <font color=\"#4f81bd\">GeologicFeature</font> appearing on a map is considered as an “instance”.",
