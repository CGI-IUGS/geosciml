	"description":"A geomorphologic feature is a kind of <font color=\"#4f81bd\">GeologicFeature</font> describing the shape and nature of the Earth's land surface. These landforms may be created by natural Earth processes (e.g., river channel, beach, moraine or mountain) or through human (anthropogenic) activity (e.g., dredged channel, reclaimed land, mine waste dumps).  In GeoSciML, the geomorphologic feature is modelled as a feature related (through <font color=\"#4f81bd\">unitDescription</font> property) to a <font color=\"#4f81bd\">GeologicUnit</font> that composes the form.",
