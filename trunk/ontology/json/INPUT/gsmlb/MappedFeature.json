	"description":"A <font color=\"#4f81bd\">MappedFeature</font> is part of a geological interpretation. It provides a link between a notional feature (description package) and one spatial representation of it, or part of it (exposures, surface traces and intercepts, etc.).  The mapped features are the elements that compose a map, a cross-section, a borehole log, or any other representation.  The mappingFrame identifies the domain being mapped by the geometries.  For typical geological maps, the mapping frame is the surface of the earth (the 2.5D interface between the surface of the bedrock and whatever sits on it; atmosphere or overburden material for bedrock maps).  It can also be abstract frames, such as the arbitrary plane that forms a mine level or a cross-section, the 3D volume enclosing an ore body or the line that approximate the path of a borehole.",
