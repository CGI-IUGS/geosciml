It includes any of a wide variety of penetrative planar geological structures that may be present in a rock.  Examples include schistosity, mylonitic foliation, penetrative bedding structure (lamination), and cleavage.  Following the proposed definition of gneiss by the NADM Science Language Technical Team, penetrative planar foliation defined by layers > 5 mm thick is considered <font color=\"#4f81bd\">Layering</font>.",
