This structure may have some significant thickness (a deformation zone) and have an associated body of deformed rock that may be considered a deformation unit (which <font color=\"#4f81bd\">geologicUnitType</font> is ‘DeformationUnit’) which can be associated to the ShearDisplacementStructure using <font color=\"#4f81bd\">GeologicFeatureRelation</font> from the GeoSciML Extension package",
