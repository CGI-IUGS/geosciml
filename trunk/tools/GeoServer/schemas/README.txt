Schemas in a local cache, including those required for GeoSciML Testbed 3.
  - Except as noted below, these are copies of published schemas.
  - Please do not edit them. 

This schema cache is intended for use by GeoServer and Eclipse.

omx is added here as a convenience. It has not yet been published.

catalog-expanded.xml is a version of catalog.xml with rewriteURI entries
rewritten as uri entries, for the convenience of Eclipse users.
Because Eclipse (3.3) does not honour rewriteURI, Eclipse users should
use this version as an XML Catalog.
