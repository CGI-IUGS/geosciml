	Types of collections of geological and geophysical objects. Examples: "borehole collection", "geological map", "geological model", "geophysical object collection" (From INSPIRE)

GeologicEvent
		An identifiable event during which one or more geological processes act to modify geological entities. A GeologicEvent may have a specified geologic age (numeric age or GeochologicEraTerm) and may have specified environments and processes. An example might be a cratonic uplift event during which erosion, sedimentation, and volcanism all take place.

GeologicEventAbstractDescription
	Stub property class to allow extended event related properties.

GeochronologicEraTerm
	Term from a Geochronological vocabulary

GeologicStructure (was already there.. added in the mean time ?)

	A configuration of matter in the Earth based on describable inhomogeneity, pattern, or fracture in an EarthMaterial. 
The identity of a GeologicStructure is independent of the material that is the substrate for the structure. 
Properties like "clast-supported",  "matrix-supported", and "graded bed" that do not involve orientation are considered kinds of GeologicStructure 
because they depend on the configuration of parts of a rock body. Includes sedimentary structures.
The general GeologicRelation is used to associate penetrative GeologicStructures with GeologicUnits.

	A configuration of matter in the Earth based on describable inhomogeneity, pattern, or fracture in an EarthMaterial.  The identity of a GeologicStructure is independent of the material that is the substrate for the structure.

GSML_QuantityRange
	GSML_QuantityRange range is a specialization of SWE Common (OGC 08-094r1, Clause 7.2.13)  QuantityRange where lower and upper values are made explicit, instead of using an array of values (RealPair, see Clause 7.2.1) where the lowest value is the first element and the highest the second.  
	
GSML_QuantityRange.lowerValue
	Lower bound of the range. Replaces the value that would be (and still be) encoded as value[0].
