Those schema validate, but there is still an issue with nillable 
(not all voidable properties were turned into nillable into XSD)


Inpire encoding contains the schema using a mixture of iso19136_2007_INSPIRE_Extensions and iso19136_2007 encoding
(was probably not a good thing)

The schemas in this folder and "mandatory" are now using gml33 encodig of shapechange

see: http://shapechange.net/targets/xsd/
