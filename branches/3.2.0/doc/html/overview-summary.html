"Map" is interpreted broadly, <br/>and not constrained to conventional 2-D semi-horizontal cartography, so the GeoSciML information structures also support representation of the distribution of <br/>geologic features on sections, along curvilinear-traverses and boreholes, and within volumetric samples, etc.  GeoSciML is primarily concerned with "interpreted" <br/>geology (units, structures, etc), but links to external schemas for the descriptions of observational data. <br/>      <br/>GeoSciML is factored into a set of 13 application schema sub-packages.  From v3.0 onwards, the component packages are maintained separately. <br/>      <br/>---<br/>      <br/>GeoSciML was developed under the auspices of the Interoperability Working Group (https://www.seegrid.csiro.au/twiki/bin/view/CGIModel/InteroperabilityWG/) <br/>of the Commission for the Management and Application of Geoscience Information (http://www.cgi-iugs.org), a commission of the International Union of Geological <br/>Sciences (http://www.iugs.org).

All rights reserved. <br/><br/>=========================================================================================<br/><br/>Changes from GeoSciML v3.0 to v3.1<br/><br/>- GeoSciML-Core package - changed cardinality of "classifier" to 1..* (voidable) <br/>- Geomorphology package - added "activity" (0..1) to NaturalGeomphologicFeature<br/>- The Borehole, Collection, EarthMaterial, GeologicAge, GeologicStructure, GeologicUnit, and LaboratoryAnalysis-Specimen schemas were advanced to v3.1 as they<br/>   import GeoSciML-Core v3.1.<br/>   <br/>=========================================================================================<br/><br/>Changes from GeoSciML v3.1 to v3.2.0 - 24 June 2013<br/><br/>- Changed import dependencies to import all v3.2 schemas<br/>- Changes to other GeoSciML packages:<br/>   - Borehole - added intervalBegin and intervalEnd attributes to DrillingDetails class.<br/>              - added mappedIntervalBegin and mappedIntervalEnd to MappedInterval class.<br/>              - the addition of discrete begin and end attributes for downhole intervals is to allow data providers to overcome limitations of various WFS <br/>                implementations which do not allow delivery of 1D spatial objects from non-spatial databases, and to work around the inability of WFS filter <br/>                to query spatial objects of varying SRS in a single WFS service.<br/>   - Collection - added collectionType attribute to the GSML class.<br/>   - Utilities - added GSML_QuantityRange class as a child of swe:QuantityRange.  The new class has two discrete attributes (lowerValue and upperValue) to deliver<br/>                 a quantity range.  This works around the inability of WFS filter to query a number pair such as in swe:QuantityRange/value.<br/>   - GeologicUnit and EarthMaterial - these packages now import Utilities to gain access to the new GSML_QuantityRange element.<br/>                 <br/>=========================================================================================</td></tr><tr><td width="20%"><a href="{382132EE-C90C-4af9-9CE5-C62354E2E355}/{35AEE937-C216-4d5a-8D68-3F780D9357AA}/package-summary.html">GeoSciML.GeoSciML-Core</a></td><td width="80%">The GeoSciML-Core schema specifies a set of feature-types describing core geoscience information, including geologic units, structures, earth materials, relations between geologic features, and spatial geometries that represent geologic features on maps.</td></tr><tr><td width="20%"><a href="{382132EE-C90C-4af9-9CE5-C62354E2E355}/{35AEE937-C216-4d5a-8D68-3F780D9357AA}/{86FBA433-65F3-49e5-AB34-5D9B236128A2}/package-summary.html">GeoSciML.GeoSciML-Core.GeologicFeature</a></td><td width="80%">The GeoSciML GeologicFeature package contains the root  Feature classes MappedFeature and GeologicFeature. <br/><br/>GeologicFeature represents a conceptual feature that is hypothesized to exist coherently in the world.

These structures are designed to be able to capture value descriptions as conventionally recorded by geologists.  <br/><br/>The Value structures are for when you need <br/>1. a qualifier, <br/>2. to be able to use either single values or ranges, or <br/>3. to express uncertainty on numeric values <br/>4. use numbers or words as alternatives for a single value or in a mixed range<br/><br/>e.g. "usually X", "greater than Y" where X and Y are either a quatity (number with a scale) or a term (word from a vocabulary) or a range constructed from measures and terms.<br/><br/>"CGI_GeometricDescriptions" allow describing the planar or linear orientation of a geologic feature. Allows specifying direction by DirectionVector (eg Dip/Dip Direction), compass point (NE), description ("toward fold hinge", "below')<br/><br/>These values are usually obtained as the result of an observation. The description of the associated observation event will provide more detail about the observation method, result quality, etc<br/><br/>"CGI_NumericAgeRange" allows the description of geological ages expressed as numbers of years before 1950</td></tr><tr><td width="20%"><a href="{382132EE-C90C-4af9-9CE5-C62354E2E355}/{7A28C9DB-4F62-4c73-824F-8495AE0D3948}/package-summary.html">GeoSciML.Collection</a></td><td width="80%">The GeoSciML Collection package contains facade classes that facilitate the structuring of WFS response documents and other application uses.</td></tr><tr><td width="20%"><a href="{382132EE-C90C-4af9-9CE5-C62354E2E355}/{5574AE3D-FBC8-49ff-8129-9E5B199D9D08}/package-summary.html">GeoSciML.EarthMaterial</a></td><td width="80%">The GeoSciML EarthMaterial package contains classes representing a description of a naturally occurring substance in the Earth.  <br/><br/>Earth Material represents material composition or substance, and is thus independent of quantity or location. Ideally, Earth Materials are defined strictly based on physical properties, but because of standard geological usage, genetic interpretations may enter into the description as well. </td></tr><tr><td width="20%"><a href="{382132EE-C90C-4af9-9CE5-C62354E2E355}/{64DC47D3-EAF8-4983-9F8A-935B53A28B5C}/package-summary.html">GeoSciML.Fossil</a></td><td width="80%">The Fossil package is provided for information only.  It is not encoded as part of the GeoSciML schemas.

The scale of geological structures ranges from microscopic (micron-scale) to megascopic (km-scale). Examples of such inhomogeneities include fractures, mineral grain boundaries, and boundaries between parts of the rock with different particle geometry (texture) or composition. Geologic structure is grounded in relationships between parts of a rock or rock body. As used here, it includes sedimentary structures. The identity of a Geologic Structure is independent of the material that is the substrate for the structure. There are almost always strong dependencies between the nature of the Earth Material substrate and the kinds of Geological Structure that may be present. A disaggregated heap of particles does not have structure, and can only be described in terms of the mineralogy and geometrical character of the constituent particles.  Geologic Structures are more likely to be found in, and are more persistent in, consolidated materials than in unconsolidated materials. Properties like "clast-supported", "matrix-supported", and "graded bed" that do not involve orientation are considered kinds of Geologic Structure because they depend on the configuration of parts of a rock body.</td></tr><tr><td width="20%"><a href="{382132EE-C90C-4af9-9CE5-C62354E2E355}/{57B9BB75-6D80-4484-B9FE-AE7A25E3AFBB}/package-summary.html">GeoSciML.GeologicTimescale</a></td><td width="80%">The Geologic Timescale package contains elements used to describe the classification of geologic time: time periods, time boundaries, and the relationships between them as defined by the International Commission on Stratigraphy.</td></tr><tr><td width="20%"><a href="{382132EE-C90C-4af9-9CE5-C62354E2E355}/{35AEE937-C216-4d5a-8D68-3F780D9357AA}/{9ABFF0A2-601A-4674-9BA8-47D7CFD29D2C}/package-summary.html">GeoSciML.GeoSciML-Core.GSSP</a></td><td width="80%">The GSSP model describes "Global Boundary Stratotype Sections and Points" as defined by the International Stratigraphy Commission.</td></tr><tr><td width="20%"><a href="{382132EE-C90C-4af9-9CE5-C62354E2E355}/{35AEE937-C216-4d5a-8D68-3F780D9357AA}/{A60E6FCB-4200-4b71-83A0-17EC90A6A2EB}/package-summary.html">GeoSciML.GeoSciML-Core.TimeScale</a></td><td width="80%">The Timescale package describes geologic time periods (geochronologic eras) and the boundaries between them.</td></tr><tr><td width="20%"><a href="{382132EE-C90C-4af9-9CE5-C62354E2E355}/{94091605-8F06-47b9-BF19-E8F1EA3EA7EC}/package-summary.html">GeoSciML.GeologicUnit</a></td><td width="80%">The GeoSciML GeologicUnit Package contains classes representing notional geologic units, whose complete and precise extent is inferred to exist.
