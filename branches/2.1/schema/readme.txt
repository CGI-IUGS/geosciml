GeoSciML version 2.1 schema files

The version 2.1 xsd schema files are copies of the version 2.0 files, EXCEPT for geologicStructure.xsd file which has had the "faultType" attribute added to ShearDisplacementStructure.  This is the only change from GeoSciML v2.0 to v2.1.

Note that there is currently no supporting HTML documentation until we either sort out FullMoon/HollowWorld issues or manually edit the v2.0 documentation.
