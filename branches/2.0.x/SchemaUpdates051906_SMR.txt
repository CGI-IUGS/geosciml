Updates to GeoSciML schema to bring up to v. 1.1 as per decisions in face to face meeting, Orleans, France
SMR 052606


All GeoSciML schema change version attribute to 1.1.0


in geologicFeature (top.xsd)
change classifier type to "gsml:ControlledConceptPropertyType" (was "gml:referenceType")
change alternateClassifier type to "gsml:ControlledConceptPropertyType" (was "gml:referenceType")

classifier: Pointer to controlled concept that defines the original intent under which the feature was defined. This classifier might be a very general concept for reporting observational data that has not been organized into named concepts (e.g. classifier is LithostratigraphicUnit for geolgoic unit descriptions in field data for which named stratigraphic units have not yet been defined). For data instances containing descriptions of named concepts (e.g. named geologic units), the classifer identifies the data as a description of some occurrence of that concept, and the prototype description feature associated with the classifier controlledConcept provides constraints on property values to be consistent with the classifier prototype. 
   Classifier Type should be gml:refence, such that Dictionary elements are always by reference. The type=gsml:ControlledConceptPropertyType assignment is made here with the idea that because we can't include vocabularies in WFS documents (they're geologicObject, not GeologicFeatures), the ControlledConcept basics (preferredName, vocabulary) should be inline, with prototype links by reference. This is a temporary measure, pending a proper strategy for "Dictionary" objects. We need to plan on using a registry solution for the latter, in parallel with the WFS solution for features. Then concepts would have identifiers that resolve to registry calls (SMR SJC 052606).

Alternative classifier: Pointer to other controlled concept which may serve to classify the object on some alternative axis. Use for classifications that are not implicit in the existing content of the feature instance. For example a lithologic classification of lithostratigraphic units that uses various combinations of genesis and composition, or interpretive assignment of a geologic unit with a complex, protracted history of deposition, deformation, and metamorphism to a single 'best representative' geologic age. The principal use case for this property is for encoding of classifications used to define derivative map views of data without generating a new feature collection defined based on the alternate classification. This follows the logic that it is important to include the 'heritage' (i.e. original definition, see classifier above) of the features with derivative classification information.
  See discussion of element type in documentation for classifier.


geologicUnit.xsd
grosschemistry type change to "gsml:CGI_TermValuePropertyType" (was "gsml:ChemicalCompositionClass")

change element name="LithoStratigraphicUnit" to element name="LithostratigraphicUnit" to match EA UML class name.

minOccurs on LithologicUnit.weatheringCharacter set to "0"
minOccurs on LithostratigraphicUnit.beddingPattern set to "0"
minOccurs on LithostratigraphicUnit.beddingStyle set to "0"
minOccurs on LithostratigraphicUnit.beddingThickness set to "0"

Copy geoTime.xsd to GeoSciML/1.1.0, change 
GeoSciML/1 schemaLocation from /xsd/GeoSciML/1.0.0/schema/metadata.xsd to 
/xsd/GeoSciML/1.1.0/schema/metadata.xsd
copy stratEnums.xsd from GeoSciML/1.0.0 to geosciML/1.1.0 because geoTime.xsd includes it.


GeologicTime.xsd
Change type of metadata element on complexType GeologicTimeScaleType from gsml:objectMetadataPropertyType to gsml:metadataPropertyType to conform with metadata schema

Change type of metadata element on complexType StratigraphicEventType from gsml:objectMetadataPropertyType to gsml:metadataPropertyType to conform with metadata schema





Issues--how to represent ordering of stratigraphic parts in a lithostratigrpahic unit within a feature collection. GeologicRelation is obvious mechanism, but it is not a gml feature, so technically can't include in wfs feature collection.

SJC--Maybe we should consider making GR a feature then ...
Discussion: Perhaps "feature" covers all the less-stable (described...) items. Object is superclass that also covers Definition (stable/named concepts that should be served from a registry rather than a feature-service and have identifiers that follow some well-known scheme[prototype]) and Geometry (which should only ever occur as the value of a feature property). GeologicFeature/GeologicObject distinction is motivated by gml metamodel that tries to make 'feature' something special because it has geometry. This specialization path is probably unnecessary. 


Validataion in xmml/subversion/trunk agains http online schema fails in xmml/1/base.xsd, '../../enumerations/LUTmaintenance.xsd' schema not found. Relative path needs to be fixed.
I tried commenting out this include in the xmml/1/base.xsd; so far things haven't gagged.
