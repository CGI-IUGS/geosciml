The GeoSciML schema and instance documents import schema which are managed by other domains.  These are located on the web. 
To validate instance documents where web access is not possible requires local versions of these remote schema.
These instructions describe how to establish local copies of the remote schema.

Changes to schema held in the remote locations will require updating your local versions.

Step 1: Extract contents of CGI-basic-schema_v2.zip to a directory (from here on refered to as <CATALOG_HOME>)

Step 2: Copy the "catalog.xml" file from this directory to <CATALOG_HOME>

Step 3: Extract contents of SCHEMAS_OPENGIS_NET.zip from http://schemas.opengis.net/ " to a new directory called <CATALOG_HOME>/SCHEMAS_OPENGIS_NET

Step 4: Use <CATALOG_HOME>/catalog.xml as the OASIS XML Catalog to validate GeoSciML documents with.
