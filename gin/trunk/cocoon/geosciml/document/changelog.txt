2008-07-19 : added a debug parameter to prevent the remove duplicate transformer 
to be used when the private document is not transformed.  Some GML2 document
don't follow the Class/property/Class rule when it comes to geometry, so it 
confuses the RemoveDuplicate transformer and end up in malformed document.
When invoking the service, you can now add &KEEPDUP param (no value) to remove 
RemoveDuplicate transformer from the flow of transformation
