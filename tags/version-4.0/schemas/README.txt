These schema validate, but there is still an issue with nillable 
(not all voidable properties were turned into nillable into XSD, association that are "composition" (dark diamond) don't have voidable attributes)

Inspire encoding contains the schema using a mixture of iso19136_2007_INSPIRE_Extensions and iso19136_2007 encoding
(was probably not a good thing)

The schemas in this folder and "mandatory" are now using gml3.3 encoding of Shapechange
