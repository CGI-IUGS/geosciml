Schemas in a local cache, including those required for GeoSciML Testbed 3.
  - Except as noted below, these are copies of published schemas.

This schema cache is intended for use by GeoServer and Eclipse.

catalog-expanded.xml is a version of catalog.xml with system/uri
entries appended for each rewrite entry, for the convenience of
Eclipse users. Because Eclipse (3.3) does not honour rewrites,
Eclipse users should use this version as an XML Catalog (rather
than catalog.xml which will be largely ignored).
