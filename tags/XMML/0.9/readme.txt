This directory contains W3C XML Schema documents that describe components in the "XMML" namespace.  
The identifier for the namespace is currently "http://www.opengis.net/xmml".  

XMML is the eXploration and Mining Markup Language, which provides XML components for transfer of information associated with mineral exploration and mining.  

XMML is a "GML Application Language", GML being the Geography Markup Language developed through the Open GIS Consortium (http://www.opengis.org).  
GML provides basic components for geography, and mandates some patterns for defining "feature-types" to encapsulate items of interest.  
XMML uses the GML components, and its feature model, to define feature-types of interest in the specific application domain of interest - i.e. mineral exploration and mining.  

More extensive documentation of XMML is available from http://xmml.arrc.csiro.au, and in particular in the TWiki pages linked from there at https://cg-twiki.arrc.csiro.au/view/Xmml/WebHome

The XMML project was supported by a consortium including
