                        Lithology: 
                        A pebbly and cobbly, well-rounded, clast-supported conglomerate of lava, psammite, quartzite and feldspar-porphyry in a matrix of poorly-sorted, fine- to medium-grained lithic sandstone, commonly with lenses of trough cross-bedded pebbly sandstone. 
                        Definition of Lower Boundary:
                        The base of the formation is placed at the top of a thick succession of andesitic lavas of the Montrose Volcanic Formation where this is conformably and somewhat diachronously overlain by a massive clast-supported conglomerate, above which it passes laterally into, and interfingers with, sandstone of the Tannadice Sandstone Member of the Scone Sandstone Formation. 
                        Definition of Upper Boundary:
                        A clast-supported conglomerate conformably, somewhat diachronously and locally interfingered with the base of a red, massive or laminated, poorly-sorted siltstone of the Cromlix Mudstone Formation. 
                        Thickness:
                        Up to 880 m thick in the type area, passing laterally into sandstone of Tannadice Sandstone Member towards the south-west. 
                        Geographical Limits:
                        North-eastern Midland Valley, between Drumlithie and the River South Esk.
