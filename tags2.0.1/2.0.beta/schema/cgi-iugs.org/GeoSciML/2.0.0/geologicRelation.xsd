        <documentation>Geologic Relations are typed, directed associations between geologic objects. Represents any of a
            wide variety of relationships that can exist between two or more GeologicFeatures? . For example, the
            GeologicRelation ?intrudes? is a relationship between an intrusive igneous rock and some host rock. Includes
            spatial, temporal, sequence, correlation, and parent/child relations. Two or more GeologicFeatures? are
            associated in a GeologicRelation; each has a role in the relationship. Examples of geological roles include
            "overlies", "is overlain by", "is younger", "is older", "intrudes", "is intruded by", and so forth. In a
            relationship where an igneous unit intrudes a sedimentary unit, the geological relationship is ?intrudes?,
            the intruded sedimentary unit has the role ?host?, and the igneous unit has the role ?intrusion?. Many other
            types of relationships can also be accommodated via GeologicRelation, for example, topological relations
            between spatial objects could be described where they are scientifically significant. </documentation>
