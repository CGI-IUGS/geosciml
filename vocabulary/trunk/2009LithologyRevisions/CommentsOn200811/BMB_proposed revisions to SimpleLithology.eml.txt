Hi Steve,

I've looked at our list more closely. In addition to silt and clay we
use:

- dolostone (subtype of 'calcareous carbonate sedimentary rock')
- limestone (subtype of 'dolomitic or magnesian sedimentary rock')
- till      (subtype of 'diamicton')
- soil      (really need something better than 'composite genesis
material')
- volcanic rock
- plutonic rock

See our attached list---in cases we changed names, but these map onto
concepts on the list.

Hi again--
The compiled recommendations for updates to the SimpleLithology
vocabulary were distributed back at the beginning of the month, and the
end of June is here. If you haven't had a chance to look over the
documents please do so ASAP and get comments back to me. The
recommendations and discussion documents are available on the
https://www.seegrid.csiro.au/twiki/bin/view/CGIModel/LithologyCategories
TWIKI page (see 'Development of new version 2009' section).
